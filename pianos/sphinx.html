                    This high-drama marvel is a historical replica of the first such piano built by
                     Bechstein in 1886 from a special exhibit in London. With over 1800 hours of
                     artisanal work and 32 months of build time this Napoleon Bonaparte Empire style 
                     grand piano will dazzle anyone who glimpses it. Covered in fire-gilded figurines
                     it combines Greek, Egyptian and Roman motifs in the essential Napoleonic Empire style. 
                     One can imagine this piano at home at Palee Garnier(the famed Parisian Opera of the same style).
                     Gleaming gold and richness of the wood combine is the symphony of decedent grandeur that will take
                     your breath away.
                     While almost half the price of Steinway, this extraordinary piano will set you back $1.2 million which
                     is warranted by the quality and uniqueness of this grand piano.
