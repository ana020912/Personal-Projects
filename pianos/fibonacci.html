                    Steinway Sons have given us the ultimate feast for the eye and mind.
                    The New York based piano juggernaut conceived this grand piano to be a 
                    material representation of the Fibonacci Series-Renaissance's divine proportion ratio.
                    Franck Pollaro designed this luxury limited edition Steinway model. At over $2 million
                    this one of the most expensive and stunning instruments produced by top piano brands.
                    It traces Fibonacci's spiral as applied to Nautilus which grows without changing its form all 
                    over the body of this grand piano. The remarkable case is inlaid with rare woods intarsia cut and
                    placed by hand to create the outer veneer. This is a true work of art worthy of the best artisans
                    of Renaissance-Fibonacci would be proud!
